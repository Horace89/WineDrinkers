## Wine Drinkers


### Recommending wines and segmenting wine drinkers

Here I explore online sales data for a wine store. In part I, I use k-means clustering to segment the customers. In Part II, I use matrix factorization to build a wine recommender.

### Documents:  
recommenders.py has functions for building recommenders.  
WineDrinkers.ipynb goes through the workflow of clustering wine drinkers.  
WineDrinkers2.ipynb goes through the workflow of building wine recommenders.
